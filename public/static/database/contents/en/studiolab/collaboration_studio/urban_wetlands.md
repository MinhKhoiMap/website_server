description: "While still preserving the current urban layout of the Thanh Da Peninsula, new housing opportunities are created on meso and micro scale. Existing housing typologies will be mixed with newly developed projects. This will stimulate social interaction and create new communities. \n Two different housing typologies are added in the micro area. This interplay of contrasting buildings and environments can be carried out further on a meso scale. This means that new urban areas can be created across the island to solve the housing crisis.\n Several water filtration systems around the border of the island can filter the polluted water from the Saigon river. During a heavy rainfall, the wetlands can also function as a retention area to protect the urban area against flooding, or in times of drought it can be stored.\n New sport, healthcare and recreation facilities are added to the Thanh Da peninsula. The farms still have its place and the sidewalks will be able to be used by the street vendors. The main road will be upgraded completely and in the south of the peninsula another connection with the main land will be created, which improves the accessibility drastically"
