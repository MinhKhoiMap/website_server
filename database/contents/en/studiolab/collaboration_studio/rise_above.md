description: The Rise Above project reimagines urban development in Thanh Da Peninsula, Ho Chi Minh City, by embracing flood resilience and community-driven design. Instead of raising land for high-rise buildings, it proposes a water-adaptive “urban archipelago” that integrates sustainable architecture, nature-based solutions, and local culture. Using sponge city principles and flood mitigation strategies, the design transforms water from a threat into an asset, ensuring a harmonious and resilient future
